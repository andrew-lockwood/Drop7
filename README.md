# Drop7

Drop7 is a game created by Zynga for iPhone and Android.  In it, numbered balls are dropped and if either the rows or the columns add up to the number on the ball, it explodes and gives you points.  

I figured I could recreate a simple version for the command line.  To play, it requires the two files in the Drop7 folder, one containing the main board and the other containing a very simple linked list implementation. 

Possible future additions: 
  1. Unknown numbers that are only revealed after an adjacent number is removed twice
  2. Scoring 
  3. Levels 
  

The original intent of the project was to train a computer to beat the game.
